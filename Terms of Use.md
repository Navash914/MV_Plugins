# Terms of Use

All of my original plugins are free to use in free and commercial RPG Maker MV games as long as credit is given, unless stated otherwise.

You can credit me as "Navash" in your game's credits.

Edits/Extension plugins to any of my original works are allowed. Publicly sharing your edit/extension is allowed as long as I am notified and have given permission. I reserve the right to deny permission for public sharing on a case by case basis.

Work that is not originally mine (such as edits or extension plugins to others' works) is subject to the terms of use of the original creator.
